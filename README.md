`gb` is a proof of concept replacement build tool for the [Go programming language](https://golang.org).

I gave a talk about `gb` and the rational for its creation at GDG Berlin in April 2015, [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3dW80eO88I) and [slides](http://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/davecheney/presentations/reproducible-builds.slide#1).

## Project based

`gb` operates on the concept of a project. A gb project is a workspace for all the Go code that is required to build your project.

A gb project is a folder on disk that contains a subdirectory named <code>src/</code>. That's it, no environment variables to set. For the rest of this document we'll refer to your <code>gb</code> project as <code>$PROJECT</code>.

You can create as many projects as you like and move between them simply by changing directories.
