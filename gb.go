// Actions and Tasks.
//
// Actions and Tasks allow gb to separate the role of describing the
// order in which work will be done, from the work itself.
// Actions are the former, they describe the graph of dependencies
// between actions, and thus the work to be done. By traversing the action
// graph, we can do the work, executing Tasks in a sane order.
//
// Tasks describe the work to be done, without being concerned with
// the order in which the work is done -- that is up to the code that
// places Tasks into actions. Tasks also know more intimate details about
// filesystems, processes, file lists, etc, that Actions do not.
//
// Action graphs (they are not strictly trees as branchs converge on base actions)
// contain only work to be performed, there are no Actions with empty Tasks
// or Tasks which do no work.
//
// Actions are executed by Executors, but can also be transformed, mutated,
// or even graphed.

// of Actions that the task depends on.
